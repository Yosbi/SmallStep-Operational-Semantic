# SmallStep-Operational-Semantic
Implementation in Haskell of a small-step operational semantics language for a programming language with arithmetic expressions, attributions, commands sequences, a skip command, and a 'par' operator for the execution of commands in parallel.

This implementation is done as seen in the book Semantics with Applications: a Formal Introduction from H.R. Nielson e F. Nielson
